# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions
My [Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solutions



## Background

Advent of code is a coding challenge put on by GitHub each year. I went through and solved them. I didn't necessarily do the best solutions as many were done last minute before I went to bed each night, but oh well.

I did all of mine in python, and left the challenge details at the top of each module so you can understand it better.
